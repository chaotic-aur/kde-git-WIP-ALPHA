# kde-git-WIP-ALPHA
kde-git very WIP and very alpha


## Builders
- builder.nu: Builds a single package
- routine.nu: Builds a routine list (the json files in each group "pkgs_*") 
- runner.nu: Runs everything
- logger.nu: displays a list of logs (all or by error type) and allows to visualize one by one


### Groups
- KF6: in pkgs_kf6.local
- PLASMA: in pkgs_plasma.local
- OTHER MISC PACKAGES: in pkgs_other.local
- KDE GEAR: in pkgs_apps.local


#### Note:
- Currently some packages needs to build from overrides or v1_backups. In the meanwhile I will rectify this issue
